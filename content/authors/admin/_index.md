I am an Associate Professor of Instruction in Industrial Engineering at the University of Iowa. My research interests are at the intersection of engineering education and human factors engineering methods. My recent focus is on exploring the use of systems engineering methods to model engineering education problems.

I am now an Honorary Editor-in-Chief in the International Journal of Industrial Engineering - Theory, Applications and Practice (IJIETAP) which I edited from 2000 to 2014. As the Editor-in-Chief for IJIETAP for 14 years, I grew the journal to attract a worldwide audience, and migrated the journal from a print to an online publication. I have also served on the editorial boards of many research journals, and have helped organize research conferences (you can find details in my research page).

I am a member of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), the Institute for Industrial and Systems Engineers, and the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. 

I am also a member of the leadership team and the webmaster for the [North Midwest Section of the ASEE](http://nms.asee.org)

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in learning more about my work.
